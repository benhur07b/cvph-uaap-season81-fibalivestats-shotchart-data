# CourtVisionPH - UAAP Season 81 FIBA LiveStats Shot Chart Data

Includes information found in the Shot Chart data of FIBA LiveStats:
- location (origin is the center of the basket)
    - **x** - distance (10 cm/unit) from center of basket along x (horizontal) axis, right is positive
    - **y** - distance (10 cm/unit) from the center of the basket along y (vertical) axis, up is positive
- **points** - 2 or 3
- **made** - 1 is made, 0 is missed
- **shot_type** - type of shot taken
- player & team information
    - **player** - name of player
    - **num** - number of player
    - **team** - team of player
    - **opponent** - opponent team in the game
- **date** - date when game was played

## Notes
x and y are in 10 cm intervals. 1 unit of x or y = 10 centimeters (0.1 meters). Meaning, a point with coordinates (10, 10) is 100cm (10 * 10cm) to the right and 100 cm away from the basket.
